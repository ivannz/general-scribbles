Consider a Banach space $(\Hcal, \|\cdot\|)$ with the norm $\Tcal^{\|\cdot\|}_\Hcal$
topology on it.

\paragraph{Linear spans} % (fold)
\label{par:linear_spans}

Let $M \subset \Hcal$ be a linear subspace of $(\Hcal, \|\cdot\|)$ and $x \notin M$.
Observe that since $M$ is a linear space $0\in M$, whence $x \neq 0$. Define $M_1$
as the linear span of $M_0 \cup \{x\}$: $M_1 = \{\alpha x + y \colon \alpha \in \real
\,,\, y \in M_0\}$.

For any $z\in M_1$ we have $z = \alpha x + y$ for some $\alpha\in \real$ and $y\in M$.
Suppose there are $(\alpha_1, y_1)$ and $(\alpha_2, y_2)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha_1 x + y_1 = \alpha_2 x + y_2
  \Leftrightarrow
    y_1 - y_2 = (\alpha_2 - \alpha_1) x
    \,,
\end{equation*}
If $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$, then $y_1 - y_2 = 0$ and thus $y_1 = y_2$. If $\alpha_1
\neq \alpha_2$, then we proceed by contradiction: dividing both sides by the difference
yields $x = -\tfrac{y_1 - y_2}{\alpha_1 -\alpha_2}$, which implies $x\in M$, since
$M$ is a linear subspace. Hence for every $z\in M_1$ there is a unique decomposition
$z = \alpha x + y$ with $\alpha\in\real$ and $y\in M$.

We can define a pair of maps $\alpha\colon M_1\to \real$ and $y\colon M_1 \to M$,
that are given, respectively, by the $\alpha\in\real$ and $y\in M$ components of
the decomposition $z = \alpha x + y$ for each $z\in M_1$. These maps are injections,
since $\alpha(z_1) = \alpha(z_2)$ and $y(z_1) = y(z_2)$ imply
\begin{equation*}
  z_1 = \alpha(z_1) x + y(z_1)
    = \alpha(z_2) x + y(z_2)
    = z_2
    \,.
\end{equation*}
By definition of $M_1$ the maps are also surjective. It is noteworthy that they are
also linear: for $u, v\in M_1$ and $\beta \in \real$
\begin{align*}
  \alpha(u + \beta v) x + y(u + \beta v)
    &= u + \beta v
    = u + \beta (v)
    \\
    &= \alpha(u) x + y(u)
      + \beta \bigl(\alpha(v) x + y(v) \bigr)
    \\
    &= \bigl( \alpha(u) + \beta\alpha(v) \bigr) x
    + \bigl( y(u) + \beta y(v) \bigr)
    \,,
\end{align*}
from which uniqueness of the decomposition implies linearity. Finally $M\subset M_1$,
since $y = 0 x + y \in M_1$ for any $y\in M$.

Therefore, the linear subspace $M_1$ is homomorphic to $\real \times M$ -- a linear
product space with addition and scaling over the field $\real$ defined naturally.
One can also easily make it into a normed space, by additively composing the norms
on $\real$ and $M$. And if $M$ was complete, then $M_1$ would also be complete with
respect to the newly defined norm.

\paragraph{Simple one dim extension} % (fold)
\label{par:simple_one_dim_extension}

Let $M_0\subseteq \Hcal$ be a linear subspace of $(\Hcal, \|\cdot\|)$, and $l$ be
a linear functional $M_0\to \real$.

For a given arbitrary $x_1\notin M_0$ let $M_1 = \{\alpha x_1 + y \colon \alpha \in
\real\,,\, y \in M_0\}$. Hence there exist linear bijections $\alpha\colon M_1\to
\real$ and $y_0\colon M_1\to M_0$ such that $z = \alpha(z) x_1 + y_0(z)$ for all
$z\in M_1$.

Define $\tilde{l}\colon M_1 \to \real$ as follows: for some $c \in \real$ for any 
$z \in M_1$ put
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{l}(z; c)
    = \tilde{l}\bigl(\alpha(z) x_1 + y_0(z) \bigr)
    = \alpha(z) \tilde{l}(x_1) + l(y_0(z))
    = \alpha(z) c + l(y_0(z))
    \,.
\end{equation*}
Note that $\tilde{l}(\cdot; c)$ inherits linearity from the maps $\alpha$ and $y_0$.
Also $\alpha(z) = 0$ and $y_0(z) = z$ on $z\in M_0$ imply that $\tilde{l}(\cdot; c)%
\big\vert_{M_0} = l$.

Thus $\tilde{l}(\cdot; c)$ for any $c\in \real$ is an extension of $l$ from $M_0
\subset \Hcal$ to the linear span of $M_0 \cup \{x_1\}$ for an $x_1\notin M_0$.

Note that the map $c\mapsto \tilde{l}(\cdot; c)$ from $\real$ to $L_{M_0}(M_1, \real)$,
i.e. the set of all extensions of $l$ to $M_1$, is a bijection. Indeed, consider some
other linear functional $f\colon M_1 \to \real$ with $f\big\vert_{M_0} = l$. Then
$\tilde{l}\bigl(\cdot; f(x_1)\bigr) = f$, since
\begin{equation*}
  f\bigl(\alpha x_1 + y \bigr)
    = \alpha f(x_1) + f(y)
    = \alpha f(x_1) + l(y)
    = \tilde{l}\bigl(\alpha x_1 + y; f(x_1)\bigr)
    \,.
\end{equation*}
For injectivity suppose $\tilde{l}(\cdot; c_1) = \tilde{l}(\cdot; c_2)$. This implies
that $\alpha (c_1 - c_2) + l(y - y) = 0$ for any $\alpha \in \real$ and $y\in M_0$.
In particular for $\alpha = c_1 - c_2$ we get $(c_1 - c_2)^2 = 0$, whence $c_1 = c_2$.

\paragraph{Extension with continuity} % (fold)
\label{par:extension_with_continuity}

Let $M_0 \subseteq \Hcal$ be a linear subspace and $l\in M_0^*$ be a continuous
linear functional on $M_0$ with $\|l\|_{M_0^*} = 1$, where
\begin{equation*}
  \|l\|_{M_0^*}
    = \sup\bigl\{\lvert l(z) \rvert\colon
        z\in M_0\,,
        \,\|z\|\leq 1
      \bigr\}
    \,.
\end{equation*}
Note that if $\|l\|_{M_0^*} \neq 1$ is nonzero and finite then we define $\hat{l}$
as $\tfrac1{\|l\|_{M_0^*}} l$, and work with that.

Pick and $x_0\notin M_0$ and let $\tilde{l}(\cdot; c)$ be an extension of $l$ from
$M_0\subset \Hcal$ to $M_1 = \{\alpha x + y \colon \alpha \in \real\,,\, y \in M_0\}$.
Since the any such extension is uniquely identified by $c$, i.e. its value on $x_1$,
by carefully choosing $c$ we shall try to make $\tilde{l} = \tilde{l}(\cdot; c)$ a
bounded linear functional.

First, note that the definition of the norm of a linear functional (operator) $\phi
\colon M\to \real$ implies that $\tfrac{\lvert \phi(z) \rvert}{\|z\|} \leq \|\phi\|_{M^*}$
for any $z\in M$ with $z \neq 0$, and $\|\phi\|_{M^*}$ is the smallest $K\in [0,
+\infty]$ such that $\lvert \phi(z) \rvert \leq K \|z\|$ for all $z\in M$.

Take $\tilde{l}$: even if its norm is $+\infty$ we still have $\lvert \tilde{l}(z)\rvert
\leq \|\tilde{l}\|_{M_1^*} \|z\|$ for all $z\in M_1$. In particular, for $z\in M_0$
we get $\lvert l(z)\rvert = \lvert \tilde{l}(z)\rvert \leq \|\tilde{l}\| \|z\|$,
whence $\|l\|_{M_0^*} \leq \|\tilde{l}\|_{M_1^*}$.

To get an upper bound on $\|\tilde{l}\|_{M_1^*}$, note the equivalence
\begin{align*}
  &\lvert \tilde{l}(z) \rvert \leq \|z\|
      \quad \forall z \in M_1
  \\ &\Leftrightarrow
    - \|\alpha x_1 + y\|
      \leq \alpha c + l(y)
      \leq \|\alpha x_1 + y\|
      \quad \forall \alpha \in \real\,, y \in M_0
  \\ &\Leftrightarrow
    - \bigl\|x_1 + \tfrac{y}\alpha\bigr\|
      \leq c + l\bigl(\tfrac{y}\alpha\bigr) \leq
        \bigl\|x_1 + \tfrac{y}\alpha\bigr\|
      \quad \forall \alpha \neq 0\,, y \in M_0
  \\ &\Leftrightarrow
    - \|x_1 + y\| \leq c + l(y) \leq \|x_1 + y\|
      \quad \forall y \in M_0
    \,.
\end{align*}
The transition from $\alpha \in \real$ to $\alpha = 0$, is valid, since $\|l\|_{M_0^*}
= 1$, $z = \alpha x_1 + y \in M_0$ whenever $\alpha = 0$, and $\tilde{l}\big\vert_{M_0}
= l$. Dividing by $\alpha \neq 0$ effectively keeps the inequality signs intact, which
can be seen by considering cases $\alpha > 0$ and $\alpha < 0$ separately. Final
equivalence, stems $M_0$'s being a linear space.

We shall show that $\|\tilde{l}\|_{M_1^*} \leq 1$ if we could find such $c$ that for
every $y \in M_0$
\begin{equation*}
  - \|x_1 + y\| - l(y) \leq c \leq \|x_1 + y\| - l(y)
    \,.
\end{equation*}
For any $y_1, y_2 \in M_0$ we have
\begin{align*}
  l(y_1) - l(y_2)
    % = l(y_1 - y_2)
    &\leq \|l\|_{M_0^*} \|y_1 - y_2\|
    % \leq \|l\|_{M_0^*} \|y_1 + x_1 - (y_2 + x_1)\|
    \leq \|y_1 + x_1 \| + \|x_1 + y_2\|
    \,, \\
  &\Leftrightarrow
  - \|x_1 + y_2\| - l(y_2)
    \leq \|y_1 + x_1 \| - l(y_1)
    \,.
\end{align*}
This implies that the left-hand side for any $y_2\in M_0$ is bounded by the right-%
hand side at any given $y_1\in M_0$, which means that for
\begin{equation*}
  c_-
    = \sup_{y_2\in M_0} - \|x_1 + y_2\| - l(y_2)
    \,\text{ and }\,
    c_+ = \inf_{y_1\in M_0} \|y_1 + x_1 \| - l(y_1)
    \,,
\end{equation*}
we have $c_- \leq c_+$ and that $[c_-, c_+]$ is nonempty. If $c\in [c_-, c_+]$, then
\begin{equation*}
  - \|x_1 + y\| - l(y) \leq c_- \leq c \leq c_+ \leq \|x_1 + y\| - l(y)
    \,,
\end{equation*}
for every $y \in M_0$. Therefore $1 = \|l\|_{M_0^*} \leq \|\tilde{l}\|_{M_1^*} \leq 1$, 
and $\tilde{l} = \tilde{l}(\cdot; c)$ is a bounded linear functional on $M_0$ with
$\tilde{l}\big\vert_{M_0} = l$ and $\|l\|_{M_0^*}=\|\tilde{l}\|_{M_1^*}$.

\paragraph{Hahn-Banach extension discussion} % (fold)
\label{par:hahn_banach_extension_discussion}

Note that $M_0$ must be a linear space, but is not required to be a closed subset
of $\Hcal$. If it is note closed, then it is possible to extend $l$ to $[M_0]$ by
setting $\tilde{l}$ to the limits of Cauchy sequences in $M_0$, provided the linear
functional (operator) $l$ is bounded.

If the space $\Hcal$ is finite dimensional, then applying the one-dim extension
until we run out of the dimensions will yield a continuous linear functional $\tilde{l}$
that extends $l$ from $M_0$ to $\Hcal$.

If the space is separable, then there is a countable subset $X$, which is everywhere
dense in $\Hcal$. Then, assuming that $M_0$ is a closed subspace, we can construct
a sequence of linear bounded extensions $\tilde{l}_n$ of $l$ from $M_0$ to the span
$M_n$ of $M_0 \cup \{x_1,\,\ldots, \,x_n\}$ for each $n\geq 1$, where $(x_n)_{n\geq1}$
enumerates the countable $X$. We get $M_n\subset M_{n+1}$ and $\tilde{l}_{n+1}\big\vert_{M_n}
= \tilde{l}_{n}$. Then $M_\infty = \bigcup_{n\geq1} M_n$ is a linear subspace, that
is also dense in $\Hcal$, since it contains $X$. At the same time $\tilde{l}_\infty$,
the {\bf union} of linear functionals $(\tilde{l}_n)_{n\geq1}$, is a linear functional
with $\tilde{l}_\infty\big\vert_{M_n} = \tilde{l}_{n}$. Thus $\tilde{l}_\infty$ can
be extended from $M_\infty$ to $[M_\infty]$ via the same Cauchy sequence limit machinery.

The core idea in the sketch of a proof resembles the main argument in the proof
of the Hahn-Banach extension in the case of a general $\Hcal$ via Zorn's lemma. The
Zornified version first claims that the family of all pairs $(M, f)$, where $M$ is
a linear subspace of $\Hcal$ and $f\in M^*$ is an extension of $l$ to $M$, has a
partially ordered set structure. In this family every totally ordered subset has
an upper bound, which by Zorn's lemma implies that the whole family has at least
one maximal element.

\paragraph{Hahn-Banach point-set separation} % (fold)
\label{par:hahn_banach_point_set_separation}

Let $C$ be a closed, convex set with $0\in \interior{C}$. Then for any $x_0\notin C$
there is $l_{x_0} \in \Hcal^*$, a continuous linear functional on $\Hcal$, such that
$l_{x_0}(x) \leq 1 < l_{x_0}(x_0)$ for $x\in C$.

Consider a linear subspace $\Lcal_{x_0} = \{t x_0\colon t\in \real\}$. $\Lcal_{x_0}$
is nontrivial, since $0 \in C$ and $x_0\notin C$. Observe that for a given $x\in \Lcal_{x_0}$
there is a unique $t_x \in \real$ such that $x = t_x x_0$ (if $(t_1 - t_2) x_0 = 0$,
then $t_1 = t_2$ because $x_0 \neq 0$).

Uniqueness implies the existence of a linear bijection $\tau\colon \Lcal_{x_0} \to
\real$ such that $z = \tau(z) x_0$ for any $z\in \Lcal_{x_0}$. Indeed, if $x, y\in
\Lcal_{x_0}$, then $\tau(x) = \tau(y)$ implies that $x = \tau(x) x_0 = \tau(y) x_0
= y$, and for any $\alpha\in \real$
\begin{equation*}
  \bigl( \tau(x) x_0 \bigr) + \bigl( \tau(y) x_0 \bigr) \alpha
    % structure of $x$ and $y$
    = x + y \alpha
    % linearity of $\Lcal_{x_0}$
    = \tau(x + y \alpha) x_0
    % uniquenes of x\mapsto t_x
  \,.
\end{equation*}

Let $p$ be the Minkowski functional of the set $C$. For this $C$ the functional $p$
is finte-valued, subadditive, positively homogenous, and continuous. The functional
$p$ is also sublinear: $0 = p(0) \leq p(t x) + p(-t x) = p(t x) - t p(x)$ for any
$t < 0$, and $t p(x) = p(t x)$ for $t \geq 0$.

Since $x_0\notin C$ and $C$ is closed, we must have $x_0\notin \{p\leq 1\}$, whence
$p(x_0) > 1$. Let $f(x) = \tau(x) p(x_0)$ for any $x \in \Lcal_{x_0}$. On $\Lcal_{x_0}$
we have $f\leq p$, since $\tau(x) p(x_0) \leq p\bigl(\tau(x) x_0\bigr) = p(x)$ by
sublinearity of $p$. At the same time $f$ inherits linearity from $\tau$.

Now, for such $C$ the Minkowski functional is bounded, i.e. there exists $0\leq M <
+\infty$, such that $p(x) \leq \|x\| M$ for any $x\in \Hcal$. Therefore if $f\leq p$,
then by linearity of $f$ and we have
\begin{equation*}
  - \|x\| M
    \leq - p(-x)
    \leq l(x)
    \leq p(x)
    \leq \|x\| M
    \,.
\end{equation*}
Hence the {\it Hahn-Banach Extension Theorem} (applied to $\tfrac1M f$, and then
scale back) there must be linear extension $l_{x_0}$ of $f$ from $\Lcal_{x_0}$ onto
$\Hcal$ with $l_{x_0}\big\vert_{\Lcal_{x_0}} = f$ and $l_{x_0} \leq p$ everywhere
on $\Hcal$. This extension is a bounded linear functional by an earlier result, and
satisfies $l_{x_0}(x) \leq p(x) \leq 1$ for any $x\in C$ and $1 < p(x_0) = \tau(x_0) p(x_0)
= f(x_0) = l_{x_0}(x_0)$.
